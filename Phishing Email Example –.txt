SUMMARY

1. Strange Email Address
It says it's from Microsoft, but the address is @m1crosoft-secure.com (they used a number “1” instead of the letter “i”).

That’s a fake domain trying to look real.

2. Weird Links
The link says “Verify Now,” but if you hover over it (without clicking), it goes to a strange website — not a real Microsoft site.

It’s a trick to steal your info.

3. Scary Language
It says your account will be locked in 24 hours.

That’s meant to make you panic and act fast without thinking — a classic phishing move.

4. Generic Greeting
It says "Dear Customer" instead of using your name. Real companies usually know who you are.

5. Grammar is Off
The message sounds a little off — like “in your account” instead of “on your account.” That’s a clue it wasn’t written by professionals.

6. Email Header Info (Advanced)
If you check the behind-the-scenes info (called the header), you’ll see the email came from a weird server — not Microsoft.
